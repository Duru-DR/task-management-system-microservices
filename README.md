# task Management System Microservices

## 📌 Overview
A distributed Task Management System built with a microservices architecture, designed to handle task tracking, notifications, and collaboration (and in the future user authentication).
This project demonstrates real-world engineering practices, including service isolation, inter-service communication, and scalability.
The system is composed of multiple microservices communicating over REST and Kafka, and is designed for cloud deployment with Docker.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Task Service – create, update, delete, assign, and track tasks.

🔔 Notification Service –  manage users' notifications sent via Kafka.

🤝 Collaboration – team assignments.

📦 Scalability – containerized with Docker, CI/CD via Jenkins

📝 Tracing - Zipkin

API Documentation via OpenApi/Swagger
